# EPL Data Website
This repository contains a Python script for analyzing book data stored in a CSV file and generating visualizations using Plotly. The csv file is provided by ePubLibre Library via RSS. The script loads the data from the CSV file, performs analysis, and creates three types of charts:

    Bar Chart of Genre Distribution: Visualizes the distribution of books across different genres.
    Pie Chart of Language Distribution: Displays the distribution of books based on their language.
    Bar Chart of Publication Trend: Illustrates the amount of books published by century.
